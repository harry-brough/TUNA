# Changelog

## TUNA 0.5.0

### Added

- Anharmonic frequencies from numerical solution of nuclear Schrödinger equation
- *Ab initio* molecular dynamics
- Unrestricted Hartree--Fock
- Unrestricted MP2 energies
- Keyword to decontract basis functions, `DECONTRACT`
- New basis sets: 4-31G, 6-31+G, 6-31++G, and 6-311+G
- Mayer bond order, free and total valences
- Spin contamination for UHF calculations
- Orbital rotation and `ROTATE` and `NOROTATE` keywords for UHF guess density
- Optimisations and molecular dynamics simulations optionally print to XYZ file with `TRAJ` and `NOTRAJ` keywords
- Option to optimize to a maximum with `OPTMAX` keyword
- Terminal output now has colour for warning and errors
- Increased speed of all TUNA calculations by 50–95% through making full use of permutational symmetry in the two-electron integrals
- Much better error handling and clear errors and warnings
- New changelog, manual, GitHub and PyPI pages 
- TUNA can now be installed simply by `pip install QuantumTUNA`

### Changed

- Rewrote all the code to make things object-oriented, improve efficiency and reduce redundancy
- Slimmed down the fish logo :(
- Optimised and simplified integral engine
- Better handling of print levels; optimizations now only calculate properties at the end by default
- Now use more energy evaluations for gradients and Hessians, making them more robust but slower 
- Generally refined the output, making information more precise and clear

### Fixed

- When its equations can't be solved, DIIS now resets instead of crashing the program
- Fixed the thermochemistry module mixing up the temperature and pressure variables
- Formatting issues with population analysis
- Fixed handling of ghost atoms, accessible by `XH` or `XHe`

<br>

## TUNA 0.4.0 

### Added

- Fock matrix extrapolation for SCF convergence (DIIS)
- Electronic and total dipole moment
- Unrelaxed MP2 density and natural orbitals
- Thermochemistry after frequency calculations, `TEMPERATURE` and `PRESSURE` keywords
- New 3-21G basis set

### Changed

- Density matrix is now read by default from previous step in coordinate scans and optimisations

### Fixed

- Unbroke level shift, added keywords

<br>

## TUNA 0.3.0

### Added

- Geometry optimisations
- Harmonic frequencies, optionally linked with prior optimisation with `OPTFREQ` calculation type
